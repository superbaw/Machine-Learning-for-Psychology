        "In this workshop we will use google colaboratory and python syntax to build a Decision Tree, which uses continuous and categorical data from the [sample data](https://github.com/superbaw/Machine-Learning-for-Psychology/blob/main/Board%20Exam.csv) to predict whether or not a college graduate has passed the board examination.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision Trees are an exceptionally useful machine learning method when you need to know how the decisions are being made. For example, if you have to justify the predictions to your superior, Decision Trees are a good method because each step in the decision-making process is easy to understand.\n",
